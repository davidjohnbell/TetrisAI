Q: How do you solve a problem that you can't brute force?
A: A Genetic Algorithm might do the trick. 

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a hueristic inspired by natural selection. Darwin theorized that individuals compete for limited resources and the most adept individuals are most likely to pass on their genes. Over many generations the characteristics that make an individual particularely adept get strenghtened and become more common throughout the population. However, every once in awhile a mutation occurs and a new, more remarkable, individual emerges.

Inspired by a YouTube video I saw from creator Siraj Rivaal I set out to make a sandbox environment where I, and hopefully others, could learn more about Genetic Algorithms. In this sandbox, individuals compete for the highest Tetris score in order to live on. Each indivual is refered to as a genome, which is homage to the gene responsible for the ability to play tetris. The gene's ability to play Tetris depends on the chromosomes, which is homage to the particular encoding of genetic information. Over several generations the genomes cross and mutate and slowly getting better at Tetris.
